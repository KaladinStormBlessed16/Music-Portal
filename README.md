To build it I used Hardhat + Solidity for the contracts, deployed in the Rinkeby testnet with Alchemy.
And of course a front to interact with it in React.

To run the test of the contract fo to music-portal-contract folder, and run:
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js

To deploy the contracts run: 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
